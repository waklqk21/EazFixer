# EazFixer [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/5i5m8d7qv97ywgmc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HoLLy-HaCKeR/eazfixer)
A deobfuscation tool for Eazfusca tor. 

## Downloading
You can download the latest master build at [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HoLLy-HaCKeR/eazfixer/build/artifacts). If there was no commit in the last 6 months, you will have to build it yourself. Please do not open issues asking for me to build it for you.

## Description
EazFixer is a deobfuscation tool for [Eazfuscator](https://www.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net), a commercial .NET obfuscator. For a list of features, see the list below.

### Implemented fixes:
* String encryption
* Resource encryption
* Assembly embedding

### Not implemented, may be added in the future:
* Entrypoint obfuscation
* Data virtualization

### Out of scope:
* Code virtualization (separate project)
* Symbol renaming (symbol names are either unrecoverable or encrypted. For symbol decryption in case of a known key, see [EazDecode](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/EazDecode))
* Automatic code optimization (not an anti-feature!)
* Code control flow obfuscation (I didn't have any problems with my samples in dnSpy)
* Assemblies merging (doesn't seem probable, especially with symbol renaming)
* Control flow obfuscation (use de4dot)

## Usage
Call from the command line or drag and drop the file on and let it run or use the command line flag `--file`.

If your assembly is protected with control-flow obfuscation, run it through [de4dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot) with the
`--only-cflow-deob` flag first.

* --file path
* --keep-types
* --virt-fix

The flag `--file` is used for the input file.
The flag `--keep-types` is similar to the de4dot flag, Keeps obfuscator types and assemblies.
The flag `--virt-fix` keeps certain parts obfuscated to stay working with [virtualized](https://help.gapotchenko.com/eazfuscator.net/30/virtualization) assemblies.

example: `EazFixer.exe --file test.exe --keep-types`

## Building
Clone the repository and use the latest version of Visual Studio (2019, at the time of writing).

## Support
EazFixer is (and will always be) targeted at the latest version of Eazfuscator. If your version is not supported, try a more universal 
deobfuscator like [de4dot](https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot). If your version is newer than what this tool supports, create an issue only 
**after** verifying with the latest version of Eazfuscator.

Also, I will not help you use this program. Consider it for advanced users only. If you do run into a problem and are sure it is a bug, 
feel free to submit an issue but I cannot guarantee I will fix it.

## Related projects

- [eazdevirt fork](https://github.com/HoLLy-HaCKeR/eazdevirt), my abandoned fork of eazdevirt, may work slightly better on newer samples.
